# Pattern DB

I want to be able to:
- paste / drag&drop images
- combine things together
- link patterns together
- give tags (n-fold, tiling)
- give description, URLs
- give a name maybeeee
- When drag&dropping, you can set some tags to auto-add, right?
  - oh, maybe just have the view filtered to those tags, and they get auto-added.
- ok when adding links, it can be a "tutorial link" or an "artwork link" or a "source link" or a "general link"
